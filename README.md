IMPORTANT: HOW TO UNBLOCK AND EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE PROPERLY

If you downloaded this ZIP file from the internet (such as from GitHub), Windows may block the files inside. This can prevent .bat, .ps1, and .reg files from running correctly.

To make sure everything works:

STEP 1: UNBLOCK THE ZIP FILE
1. Right-click the ZIP file (regeditortweakinspector.zip)
2. Select "Properties"
3. Check the box that says "Unblock" (if visible)
4. Click Apply, then OK

STEP 2: USE WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER TO EXTRACT
1. Right-click the ZIP file again
2. Choose "Extract All..."
3. Select a folder and extract the files

DO NOT USE WINRAR OR 7-ZIP TO EXTRACT
These tools do not preserve the unblocked status. Use Windows File Explorer to ensure all files run correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Unblock the ZIP Before Extracting

If you don't unblock the ZIP file before extracting it, Windows may block the scripts inside (like .ps1, .bat, and .reg).

To avoid this:

1. Right-click the downloaded regeditortweakinspector.zip file.
2. Select Properties.
3. At the bottom of the window, check the box labeled Unblock.
4. Click Apply, then OK.
5. Now extract the ZIP — everything inside will work without extra steps.
